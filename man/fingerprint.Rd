\usage{
fingerprint(name)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of the function to be analyzed}
}
\value{
A fingerprint (hash) of all provided sources
}
\description{
Function which creates a unique fingerprint for a madrat function based on
the code of the function itself, other madrat functions which are called by
this function and of all source folders involved in the process.
The fingerprint can serve as an indication whether the workflow for the given
function has been most likely changed, or not. If all involved source folders
and the code of all involved functions remains the same, also the fingerprint
will stay the same, otherwise it will change. Hence, it can be to figure out
whether a cache file can be used for further calculations, or whether the
calculation should be redone.
}
\note{
For a better performance only the first 300 bytes of each file and the
corresponding file size is hashed.
As the fingerprint function only takes madrat-based functions into account
(e.g. read-functions or calc-functions), but does ignore all other functions
there might be cases where calculations actually changed, but the fingerprint
is still the same. In a similar fashion it is possible that the fingerprint
changes even though the workflow stayed the same
(as the dependencies are sometimes overestimated).
